## It's been a while

It's been almost 2 years since my last update on pooltool. Usually that's an indication that the project is dead, but I'm here doing CPR. In fact, despite the radio silence, I've been working on pooltool alongside what has been an eventful 2 years with finishing my PhD, starting a new job, moving countries, yada, yada, yada. During that time I could never find the energy to give a formal update on the project, but that's coming to an end right now!

Since it's been so long, there's really no hope of giving any satisfyingly detailed report with commit hashes, correlating features with code snippets, etc. Instead I'm keep things relaxed with a devlog update. Please enjoy:
