## Goal

In the [last]({{ site.url }}/2020/04/24/pooltool-start/) post I implemented a prototype of the simulator that includes some unfinished physics. Then I wrote up a small class that visualizes shots with `pygame`. Touching up some of the physics and working on the visualization, that now looks like this:

[![bye_pygame]({{images}}/bye_pygame.gif){:.no-border}]({{images}}/bye_pygame.gif){:.center-img .width-60}

I think you'd agree it looks pretty good, almost like a pool game you might have found on [www.addictinggames.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20050204011135/http://www.addictinggames.com/) in '05.

But my plans are much more ambitious than visualizing shots on a pixel-art table. **My goal is to turn this simulation into an interactive, 3D game/tool**. That's what this post is about.

## My credentials for making a game

None.

## Game engine selection

If I was a game developer, I would have written this in C# or C++, using [Unity](https://unity.com/) or [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) as my game engine. But I'm not, so I decided to use a **game engine with Python support**.

It turns out, there is only 1 option that deserves consideration: **[panda3d](https://www.panda3d.org/)**. Fortunately, it's by no means a bad option. Originally developed by Disney, it was the game engine for the critically acclaimed [ToonTown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CEX1DLK5WU) (among a few other titles), and then they later open-sourced it in a collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University for the purposes of using it as an educational tool.

Today, panda3d is a fully-featured, open-source game engine that remains under active development. It has good documentation and a relatively small, yet charitable and welcoming community. I must say, I feel a small sense of home every time I visit the [Discourse](https://discourse.panda3d.org/c/general-discussion) and in general, I've had a wonderful time using panda3d so far.

## Getting something going

After successfully completing the [panda3d tutorial](https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/introduction/tutorial/index), I had created somewhat of a masterpiece:

[![panda]({{images}}/panda.gif){:.no-border}]({{images}}/panda.gif){:.center-img .width-90}

But Michelangelo didn't stop painting after he completed the Sistine Chapel. After some time, I managed to squeeze a pool table into the scene.

[![jungle_pool]({{images}}/jungle_pool.gif){:.no-border}]({{images}}/jungle_pool.gif){:.center-img .width-90}

Is the animation the wrong speed? Yes. Are the balls actually little smiley faces? Yes. But pooltool has officially gone 3D.

Next, I started working on a mouse-based camera system. To orient the camera based on mouse movements, I needed to track mouse movements. To no one's surprise, panda3D has a mouse-watcher object called [`mouseWatcherNode`](https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/reference/panda3d.core.MouseWatcher) that can query the mouse's current position. So I wrote a class called `Mouse` that uses `mouseWatcherNode` and a [`ClockObject`](https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/reference/panda3d.core.ClockObject) to track changes in mouse movement:

```python
class Mouse(ClockObject):
    def __init__(self):
        ClockObject.__init__(self)

        self.mouse = base.mouseWatcherNode
        self.tracking = False


    @staticmethod
    def hide():
        props = WindowProperties()
        props.setCursorHidden(True)
        base.win.requestProperties(props)


    @staticmethod
    def show():
        props = WindowProperties()
        props.setCursorHidden(False)
        base.win.requestProperties(props)


    def track(self):
        if not self.tracking and self.mouse.hasMouse():
            self.last_x, self.last_y = self.get_xy()
            self.last_t = self.getFrameTime()
            self.tracking = True


    def get_x(self, update=True):
        x = self.mouse.getMouseX()

        if update:
            self.last_x = x
            self.last_t = self.getFrameTime()

        return x


    def get_y(self, update=True):
        y = self.mouse.getMouseY()

        if update:
            self.last_y = y
            self.last_t = self.getFrameTime()

        return y


    def get_xy(self, update=True):
        x, y = self.get_x(update=False), self.get_y(update=False)

        if update:
            self.last_x = x
            self.last_y = y
            self.last_t = self.getFrameTime()

        return x, y


    def get_dx(self, update=True):
        last_x  = self.last_x
        return self.get_x(update=update) - last_x


    def get_dy(self, update=True):
        last_y  = self.last_y
        return self.get_y(update=update) - last_y
```

The most important methods in this class are `get_dx` and `get_dy` which return how far and in what direction the mouse has moved since last queried.

Next I setup a task called `update_camera` that's called every single frame. `update_camera` gets the change in mouse position by calling `get_dx` and `get_dy` and then associates these changes in mouse position to changes the camera's position relative to some focal point.

```python
    def update_camera(self):
        if self.keymap[action.fine_control]:
            fx, fy = 2, 0
        else:
            fx, fy = 10, 3

        alpha_x = self.dummy.getH() - fx * self.mouse.get_dx()
        alpha_y = max(min(0, self.dummy.getR() + fy * self.mouse.get_dy()), -45)

        self.dummy.setH(alpha_x) # Move view laterally
        self.dummy.setR(alpha_y) # Move view vertically
```

Here it is in action.

[![camera_rotate]({{images}}/camera_rotate.gif){:.no-border}]({{images}}/camera_rotate.gif){:.center-img .width-90}

Next, I added a cue stick that follows the camera's orientation:

[![cue]({{images}}/cue.gif){:.no-border}]({{images}}/cue.gif){:.center-img .width-90}

[[Browse code]](https://github.com/ekiefl/pooltool/commit/9869fd9d5c6f7c48aaf2b2196dcbc937723fc2e3)

I also added the ability to stroke the cue by holding 's' and moving the mouse up and down:

[![stroke]({{images}}/stroke.gif){:.no-border}]({{images}}/stroke.gif){:.center-img .width-90}

[[Browse code]](https://github.com/ekiefl/pooltool/commit/9869fd9d5c6f7c48aaf2b2196dcbc937723fc2e3)

Just like in real pool where you often walk around the table to check out the angles, the camera shouldn't be pinned to a single ball. So when you hold down 'v', you can around the table. And by holding down right-click, you can zoom in or out with the mouse:

[![pan_and_zoom]({{images}}/pan_and_zoom.gif){:.no-border}]({{images}}/pan_and_zoom.gif){:.center-img .width-90}

## Robust, object-oriented design

If I keep moving at this speed the codebase is going to turn into spaghetti. The problem is that I lack a good object-oriented design.

## Mode management

The first missing piece is the proper management of tasks.

A task is just a method that's called each frame. For example, `update_camera` shown above was a task that controlled camera movement with the mouse. If you wanted, you could flatten the code complexity and have just a single task carries out all your desired functionality. For example, here's a task that accomplishes all of the above functionality:

```python
def master_task(self, task):
    self.update_camera_rotation()
    self.update_camera_pan()
    self.update_camera_zoom()
    self.update_stroke_position()
    return task.cont
```

This task delegates to respective methods and all is good. Except, depending on different scenarios, the mouse should do different things. Holding 's', it should control the cue's displacment; holding 'right-click', it should zoom the camera; holding 'v', it should pan the camera, etc. Yet in the above example, it does all of these things simultaneously. Let's be a little more careful:

```python
def master_task(self, task):
    if self.keymap['v']:
        self.update_camera_pan()
    elif self.keymap['right-click']:
        self.update_camera_zoom()
    elif self.keymap['s']:
        self.update_stroke_position()
    else:
        self.update_camera_rotation()
    return task.cont
```

Good, now what if I want to allow panning and zooming at the same time?

```python
def master_task(self, task):
    if self.keymap['v'] and self.keymap['right-click']:
        self.update_camera_pan()
        self.update_camera_zoom()
    elif self.keymap['v']:
        self.update_camera_pan()
    elif self.keymap['right-click']:
        self.update_camera_zoom()
    elif self.keymap['s']:
        self.update_stroke_position()
    else:
        self.update_camera_rotation()
    return task.cont
```

The logic is becoming more branched and complex, and the game barely does anything. Further down this ill-conceived design, this method is going to start blowing up with nested conditionals. So my solution was to define **game modes**. A game mode, or mode for short, represents a state that the game can be in. For example, the menu system is a mode. Aiming the cue stick is a mode. Viewing a shot is a mode. All modes manage their own tasks, that turn on and off depending on which mode is active. Whenever the game switches modes, an exit method is called for the current mode that tears down all of the current tasks, rendered objects, etc., and then an enter method is called for the next mode that builds up all of the new tasks, rendered objects, etc.

All modes inherit from this simple base class:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Mode(ABC):
    keymap = None

    def __init__(self):
        if self.keymap is None:
            raise NotImplementedError("Child classes of Mode must have 'keymap' attribute")


    @abstractmethod
    def enter(self):
        pass


    @abstractmethod
    def exit(self):
        pass
```

`Mode` inherits from `ABC` (from the abstract class library `abc`) that offers some defensive coding relating to inheritance. For example, any and all modes must possess `enter` and `exit` methods, and the `@abstractmethod` decorator ensures that. So an inheriting class without `enter` and `exit` methods can't instantiate without error:

```python
class NewMode(Mode):
    pass
NewMode()
```

```
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class NewMode with abstract methods enter, exit
```

The solution is to define `enter` and `exit` methods:

```python
class NewMode(Mode):
    def enter(self): pass
    def exit(self): pass
NewMode()
```

Some more defensive coding: each mode must possess a dictionary called `keymap` that defines actions and whether or not they are active. By defining `keymap` as a class attribute and setting it to `None`, and then complaining in the `__init__` if `keymap is None`, it is ensured that any inheriting class will fail object instantiation unless it explicitly defines its `keymap`:

```python
class NewMode(Mode):
    def enter(self): pass
    def exit(self): pass
NewMode()
```

```
NotImplementedError: Child classes of Mode must have 'keymap' attribute
```

The solution is to define a `keymap` either as a class attribute or instance attribute

```python
class NewMode(Mode):
    keymap = {'zoom': False}
    def enter(self): pass
    def exit(self): pass
NewMode()
```

Here is a currently implemented game mode, `ViewMode`. This refers to the mode in which the player possesses a free-form camera that can be rotated, panned, and zoomed.

[![view_mode]({{images}}/view_mode.gif){:.no-border}]({{images}}/view_mode.gif){:.center-img .width-90}

```python
class ViewMode(CameraMode):
    keymap = {
        action.aim: False, # rotate camera
        action.move: True, # pan the camera
        action.quit: False, # exit to menu
        action.zoom: False, # zoom the camera
    }


    def enter(self):
        self.mouse.hide()
        self.mouse.relative()
        self.mouse.track()

        self.task_action('escape', action.quit, True)
        self.task_action('mouse1', action.zoom, True)
        self.task_action('mouse1-up', action.zoom, False)
        self.task_action('a', action.aim, True)
        self.task_action('v', action.move, True)
        self.task_action('v-up', action.move, False)

        self.add_task(self.view_task, 'view_task')
        self.add_task(self.quit_task, 'quit_task')


    def exit(self):
        self.remove_task('view_task')
        self.remove_task('quit_task')


    def view_task(self, task):
        if self.keymap[action.aim]:
            self.change_mode('aim')
        elif self.keymap[action.zoom]:
            self.zoom_camera()
        elif self.keymap[action.move]:
            self.move_camera()
        else:
            self.rotate_camera(cue_stick_too=False)

        return task.cont


    def quit_task(self, task):
        if self.keymap[action.quit]:
            self.keymap[action.quit] = False
            self.change_mode('menu')
            self.close_scene()

        return task.cont


    def zoom_camera(self):
        with self.mouse:
            s = -self.mouse.get_dy()*0.3

        self.cam.node.setPos(autils.multiply_cw(self.cam.node.getPos(), 1-s))


    def move_camera(self):
        with self.mouse:
            dxp, dyp = self.mouse.get_dx(), self.mouse.get_dy()

        h = self.cam.focus.getH() * np.pi/180 + np.pi/2
        dx = dxp * np.cos(h) - dyp * np.sin(h)
        dy = dxp * np.sin(h) + dyp * np.cos(h)

        f = 0.6
        self.cam.focus.setX(self.cam.focus.getX() + dx*f)
        self.cam.focus.setY(self.cam.focus.getY() + dy*f)


    def rotate_camera(self):
        if self.keymap[action.fine_control]:
            fx, fy = 2, 0
        else:
            fx, fy = 13, 3

        with self.mouse:
            alpha_x = self.cam.focus.getH() - fx * self.mouse.get_dx()
            alpha_y = max(min(0, self.cam.focus.getR() + fy * self.mouse.get_dy()), -90)

        self.cam.focus.setH(alpha_x) # Move view laterally
        self.cam.focus.setR(alpha_y) # Move view vertically
```


From the `keymap` you can see there are 4 different actions that this mode supports

```python
    keymap = {
        action.aim: False, # rotate camera
        action.move: True, # pan the camera
        action.quit: False, # exit to menu
        action.zoom: False, # zoom the camera
    }
```

Whenever this mode is entered, `enter` is called:

```python
    def enter(self):
        self.mouse.hide()
        self.mouse.relative()
        self.mouse.track()

        self.task_action('escape', action.quit, True)
        self.task_action('mouse1', action.zoom, True)
        self.task_action('mouse1-up', action.zoom, False)
        self.task_action('a', action.aim, True)
        self.task_action('v', action.move, True)
        self.task_action('v-up', action.move, False)

        self.add_task(self.view_task, 'view_task')
        self.add_task(self.quit_task, 'quit_task')
```

So what happens when `enter` is called? First, some changes to the mouse are made. The mouse is made invisible, and set to a [relative mode](https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/programming/hardware-support/mouse-support) where the cursor is repositioned to the center of the screen so it never moves out of the game window. Then, mouse tracking is turned on so changes in movement can be associated to camera movements. Next, the actions in `keymap` are explicitly associated to mouse/keyboard inputs. Upon defining these key-bindings, the values in `keymap` will be set to `True` or `False` every frame depending on which keys are being pressed.

And finally, 2 tasks called `view_task` and `quit_task` are added to a panda3d built-in task manager. If you look at the guts of `view_task` and `quit_task`, you'll see they carry out operations depending on which keys are being pressed.

Whenever this mode is exited, `exit` is called:

```python
    def exit(self):
        self.remove_task('view_task')
        self.remove_task('quit_task')
```

Quite simply, the two tasks that were added to the task manager in `enter` are removed from the task manager in `exit`.

In total, I currently have 5 game modes which can be found in the `pooltool.ani.modes` [module](https://github.com/ekiefl/pooltool/tree/proper-cushions/pooltool/ani/modes).

To manage switching between modes and reliably carrying out build-up and tear-down operations, I wrote a [`ModeManager`](https://github.com/ekiefl/pooltool/blob/a57bad6b3d03a997b0d64aaca3c51a2c22aa4cfa/pooltool/ani/animate.py#L22):

```python
class ModeManager(MenuMode, AimMode, StrokeMode, ViewMode, ShotMode):
    def __init__(self):
        # Init every Mode class
        MenuMode.__init__(self)
        AimMode.__init__(self)
        StrokeMode.__init__(self)
        ViewMode.__init__(self)
        ShotMode.__init__(self)

        self.modes = {
            'menu': MenuMode,
            'aim': AimMode,
            'stroke': StrokeMode,
            'view': ViewMode,
            'shot': ShotMode,
        }

        # Store each classes current keymap as its default
        self.action_state_defaults = {}
        for mode in self.modes:
            self.action_state_defaults[mode] = {}
            for a, default_state in self.modes[mode].keymap.items():
                self.action_state_defaults[mode][a] = default_state

        self.mode = None
        self.keymap = None


    def update_keymap(self, action_name, action_state):
        self.keymap[action_name] = action_state


    def task_action(self, keystroke, action_name, action_state):
        """Add action to keymap to be handled by tasks"""

        self.accept(keystroke, self.update_keymap, [action_name, action_state])


    def change_mode(self, mode, exit_kwargs={}, enter_kwargs={}):
        assert mode in self.modes

        self.end_mode(**exit_kwargs)

        # Build up operations for the new mode
        self.mode = mode
        self.keymap = self.modes[mode].keymap
        self.modes[mode].enter(self, **enter_kwargs)


    def end_mode(self, **kwargs):
        # Stop watching actions related to mode
        self.ignoreAll()

        # Tear down operations for the current mode
        if self.mode is not None:
            self.modes[self.mode].exit(self, **kwargs)
            self.reset_action_states()


    def reset_action_states(self):
        for key in self.keymap:
            self.keymap[key] = self.action_state_defaults[self.mode][key]
```

`change_mode` changes modes by carrying out build-up and tear-down operations for the respective modes. Because `ModeManager` inherits all of the modes, methods in modes can call `change_mode` to facilitate mode switching. For example, the `quit_task` method in `ViewMode` changes the mode to `MenuMode` by calling `self.change_mode('menu')`.

```python
    def quit_task(self, task):
        if self.keymap[action.quit]:
            self.keymap[action.quit] = False
            self.change_mode('menu')
            self.close_scene()

        return task.cont
```

## The inheritance diagram

So that's how mode management works. This is how `ModeManagement` fits into the inheritance diagram for the game:

[![inheritance]({{images}}/inheritance.jpeg)]({{images}}/inheritance.jpeg){:.center-img .width-90}

Red lines show the direction of inheritance (_e.g._ `ViewMode` inherits from `Mode`) and blue lines indicates composition (_e.g._ `Interface` makes an instances of `Table`). On the right hand side are all of the objects like `Table`, `Cue`, and `Ball`. Each of these inherit from a base class `Object`, and further inherit from respective `Render` classes that contain all logic relating to rendering procedures. By packaging this rendering responsibility into separate classes, objects remain fully operational for non-rendered circumstances.

The class that glues everything together is `Interface`, which inherits from `ModeManager`, and therefore can switch between game modes. It also holds instances of `Table`, `Cue`, and `Ball` objects, which brings these objects into the namespace of tasks setup by the game modes. This is critical because it enables tasks to create, modify, and destroy objects and their rendered states based off of user action.
