I am a scientist, software developer, and amateur pool player. I enjoy pursuing tech-related
hobbies, open source software, and embracing unorthodoxy. Currently, I'm pursuing a PhD at the
University of Chicago, where I study the ecology and evolution of ocean bacteria. I consider myself
a computational biologist, but before I wore this hat, I engaged in more physics-based research while
completing my BSc at the University of Victoria. You can find more about my research at my [Google
Scholar]({{ google_scholar[0].url }}) page.

One major consequence of pursuing my PhD--besides having less money than my friends--has been my
introduction into the world of open source software. Currently, I am one of the main developers of
[anvi'o](http://merenlab.org/software/anvio/), a community-driven software platform that stands on
more than 90,000 lines of open-source code that support interactive and fully integrated access to
state-of-the-art multiâ€™omics data and analysis strategies. The overarching intention of the software
is to enable microbiologists with the tools necessary to analyze the explosion of sequencing data
that has become available in the last decade.

Another major consequence of pursuing my PhD--besides being [6 times more
likley](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/12/06/new-research-graduate-student-mental-well-being-says-departments-have-important)
to have moderate-to-severe depression--has been my perpetual struggle in maintaining a proper
work-life balance. For the first 3 years of my PhD, I have to say I failed miserably at that and
typically worked more than 12 hours a days. This was by my own accord, by the way (unlike many
students at R01 institutions, my advisor isn't a slave driver). Because of this I ended up
destroying my wrists from typing-induced repetitive stress injury (RSI). When things first started
getting bad, instead of slowing down, I instead learned how to code with my voice and eyes. That's a
pretty confusing sentence, but it's true. Using Talon as a hands-free input framework, I have
developed my own personal language for interacing with code. I'll write a blog post about this in
the future, but for now I feel it's best explained through [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBhBqlQj00Q&t=1s), where I code with my voice, and control
the mouse with my eyes. Re-establishing proper work-life balance and managing my RSI is an ongoing
effort.

Realistically, these two by-products of my PhD have served as the cornerstone of my capabilities as
a software developer, and have greatly influenced my interests in tech.
