I am a scientist, software developer, and amateur pool player. I enjoy pursuing tech-related
hobbies, open source software, and embracing unorthodoxy. Currently, I'm pursuing a PhD at the
University of Chicago, where I study the ecology and evolution of ocean bacteria. I consider myself
a computational biologist, but before I wore this hat, I engaged in more physics-based research while
completing my BSc at the University of Victoria. You can find more about my research at my [Google
Scholar]({{ google_scholar[0].url }}) page.

Below are a couple of things that play a significant role in my skills and interests as a software
developer.

#### Anvi'o

One major consequence of pursuing my PhD--besides having less money than my friends--has been my
introduction into the world of open source software. Currently, I am one of the main developers of
[anvi'o](http://merenlab.org/software/anvio/), a community-driven software platform that stands on
more than 90,000 lines of open-source code that support interactive and fully integrated access to
state-of-the-art multiâ€™omics data and analysis strategies. The overarching intention of the software
is to enable microbiologists with the tools necessary to analyze the explosion of sequencing data
that has become available in the last decade.


#### Talon

Another major consequence of pursuing my PhD--besides being [6 times more
likley](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/12/06/new-research-graduate-student-mental-well-being-says-departments-have-important)
to have depression--has been my perpetual struggle in maintaining a proper work-life balance. For
the first 3 years of my PhD, I have to say I failed miserably at that and typically worked more than
12 hours a day because I liked work my work so much. Because of this unhealthy lifestyle I ended up
destroying my wrists from typing-induced repetitive stress injury (RSI). Rather than taking this as
a warning sign and slowing down, I learned how to code with my voice and eyes. That's a pretty
confusing sentence, but it's true. Using [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/) as a hands-free input
framework, I have developed my own personal language for interacing with code. I'll write a blog
post about this in the future, but for now I feel it's best explained through [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukmpPN9J8-Y&t=1s), where I code with my voice, and control
the mouse with my eyes. I consider this aspect of my life bittersweet, because **(1)** it is so god
damn cool (*good*) and **(2)** it illustrates how difficult it is for me to establish a healthy
work-life balance, which is embarassing (*bad*). Despite this talent of mine, it does not serve as a
replacement for typing, since doing it for a long periods of time strains my throat, which can
become more uncomfortable than wrist pain. As a result, establishing a proper work-life balance and
managing my RSI is an ongoing effort for me.
