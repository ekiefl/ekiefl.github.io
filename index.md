# About Me

{% assign google_scholar = site.author.links | where: "label", "Google Scholar" %}

I am a scientist, software developer, and amateur pool player. I enjoy pursuing tech-related hobbies, open source software, and embracing unorthodoxy. I got my PhD at the University of Chicago, where I studied the ecology and evolution of ocean bacteria. I consider myself a computational biologist, but before I wore this hat, I engaged in more physics-based research while completing my BSc at the University of Victoria. You can find more about my research at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WxWOLg0AAAAJ&hl=en) page. Currently, I'm a protein bioinformatician at Arcadia Science.
