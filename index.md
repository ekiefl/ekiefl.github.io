# Welcome

Consider this site like a scrapbook for my intellectual hobbies. Rather than hide them on my harddrive, I'm putting them online for 3
reasons: First, I wanted to learn how to make a website (check). Second, I think the content is worth sharing to anyone who is interested. And third, when you publicly broadcast your work, it makes you do your work better because the false belief that
people care enforces a higher level of self-scrutiny.

So that's the point of this website. Welcome! Visit the [About](/about/) page if you want to learn
more about me, or go straight to my [Projects](/projects/) or [Blog](/posts/).
