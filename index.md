# Welcome

The intention of this site is to log the motivation, progress, success, and failure of my
intellectual hobbies. Rather than hide this on my harddrive, I chose to put this online this for 3
reasons: First, I wanted to learn how to make a shitty website (check). Second, I naively assume
that my words may occassionally be interesting or useful to other people. And third, when you
broadcast your work to the public, it makes you do your work better because the false belief that
people care enforces a higher level of self-scrutiny.

So that's the point of this website. Welcome! Visit the [About](/about/) page if you want to learn
more about me, or go straight to my [Projects](/projects/) or [Blog](/posts/).
