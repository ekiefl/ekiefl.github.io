# Software For Fun

This site a scrapbook for my intellectual hobbies. Rather than hide them on my harddrive, I'm putting them online so that they can be freely viewed, enjoyed, and built upon.

So that's the point of this website. Welcome! Visit the [About](/about/) page if you want to learn
more about me, or go straight to my [Projects](/projects/) or [Blog](/posts/).
