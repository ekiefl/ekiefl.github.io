## Homepage of **maple**

This is the homepage for my project *maple*, an [open source](https://github.com/ekiefl/maple) software I have developed for self-monitoring my dog. The tool features audio event detection and classification, interactive plots for analyzing dog behavior, and intervening logic so that you can praise your dog for being quiet, scold it for barking, etc.

Below you can find the blog series for this project.
