## Homepage of **maple**

This is the homepage for my project *maple*, an open source software I have developed for self-monitoring your dog. The tool features audio event detection and classification, interactive plots for analyzing dog behavior, and intervening logic so that you can praise your dog for being quiet, console it for whining, scold it for barking, with pre-recorded audio of yourself.

Below you can find the blog series for this project.
